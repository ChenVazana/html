<h2>Hi everyone...</h2>
<p>My name is Milka, I was adopted 4 years ago when I was 1 year old 
    by my<br> 
    lovely parents from Beer Sheva shelter.<br>
    I am mixed breed, Cnaan and other unknown, dog from the Bedouin diaspora.<br>
    I like to play with a very specific little dogs, when I see a big 
    dogs I get crazy (in a bad way).<br>
    I have a problem with my liver so my mom takes me every month to the vet fot blood tests.
